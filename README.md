# draft-rsalz-update-registries
Repo for IETF update-registries draft

This is currently an individual draft, but will soon be submitted to the NTP WG for adoption.

The NTP WG currently does not have a GitHub presence, so I expect that this repository
will continue to be the "home" for the draft even if the working group adopts it.
